[A data structures and algorithms Ruby challenge from the Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

What data structure is used to implement DFS?

	Stack

What data structure is typically used to implement BFS?

	Queue

Which one can be done recursively? (the clue should be the data structure)

	Stack

Which one would you use to print a list of all the nodes in a tree or graph, starting with depth 1, then depth 2, then depth 3 etc.?

	BFS

What is the difference between a tree and a graph?

	Tree does not have loops and there's only one path from each node to another whereas Graph may have a loop. Tree is a special graph
