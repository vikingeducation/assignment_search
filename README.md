1. **What data structure is used to implement DFS?**  
Graph

2. **What data structure is typically used to implement BFS?**  
Tree

3. **Which one can be done recursively? (the clue should be the data structure)**  
DFS

4. **Which one would you use to print a list of all the nodes in a tree or graph, starting with depth 1, then depth 2, then depth 3 etc.?**  
BFS

5. **What is the difference between a tree and a graph?**    
A tree is a specific kind of graph that has a root node, a hierarchy, and no cycles.
