[A data structures and algorithms Ruby challenge from the Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

# By Farruh Umarov


# What data structure is used to implement DFS?
  Stack is used for DFS implementation.

# What data structure is typically used to implement BFS?
  Queue is used for BFS implementation

#  Which one can be done recursively? (the clue should be the data structure)
  DFS

# Which one would you use to print a list of all the nodes in a tree or graph, starting with depth 1, then depth 2, then depth 3 etc.?
  BFS

# What is the difference between a tree and a graph?  
  Tree has one root, whereas in graph there is no root.
