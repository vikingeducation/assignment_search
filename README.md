# Searching a simple tree of nodes where each Node has an array of child nodes (some_node.children) using DFS.


# Check node to see if it is what we're looking for. Return it if it is. Otherwise add children to stack. Recur.

# Searching the same tree using BFS.

# Check node if it is what we're looking for. Return it if it is. Otherwise add children to queue. Recur.
