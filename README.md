What data structure is used to implement DFS?
stack

What data structure is typically used to implement BFS?
queue

Which one can be done recursively? (the clue should be the data structure)
DFS

Which one would you use to print a list of all the nodes in a tree or graph, starting with depth 1, then depth 2, then depth 3 etc.?
BFS

What is the difference between a tree and a graph?
A tree has only one parent and spreads out from a root node, a graph can have
