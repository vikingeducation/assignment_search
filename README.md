Warmup 1: BFS and DFS Concepts

Before getting started, it's critical that you understand the concepts behind (and the differences between) depth-first search and breadth-first search. Start by answering the following questions in your README file:

What data structure is used to implement DFS? graph/tree
What data structure is typically used to implement BFS? graph
Which one can be done recursively? (the clue should be the data structure) DFS
Which one would you use to print a list of all the nodes in a tree or graph, starting with depth 1, then depth 2, then depth 3 etc.? BFS
What is the difference between a tree and a graph? 
  Tree: special type of graph; children have only one parent, only one edge between any two nodes; no loops (cycles)
  Graph: no child/parent relationships; edges can go to any other node; can have more than one edge between any two nodes; can have loops (cycles), etc.
